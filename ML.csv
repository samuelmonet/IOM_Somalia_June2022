"	"The main factors that influence on the well being of the respondent is longitude and given that only the highest values of longitude tend to decrease the well beeing it means that people are feeling less well in Malakal compared to the other 2 counties.
The other main factor is to have received a training inconflict transformation and dialogue skills and to feel that this had a significant improvement in basic knowledges on conflict transformations.

The other factors which have influence but a lesser impact are:

For contributing to reducing the well beign:
- The fact to pay for water
- Having a higher income per family member

For those contribution to increasing the well being:
- Having received Counselling from IOM
- Having received NFI/Shelter and having the feeling that they were distributed in a safe manner (ie this was particularly the case in Bentiu)

"	"Here we can see that very few of the aspect that influence the most the impression that the project. improved the access to safe appropriate emergency shelter and lifesaving NFIs has anything to do with NFI distributions.
The main aspect which are coming out are more GBV related activities (improvement of overall knowledge and participation to Basic Counselling and access to WGFS)
The other main factor that tend to have had an influence on the perception of the project as having improved the access to appropriate emergency shelter and lifesaving NFIs is not to have received the Shelter/NFI items in a safe manner and to live in Bentiu."
