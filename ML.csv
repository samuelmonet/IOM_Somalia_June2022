"	"The main factor that contribute to a positive perception regarding the government rôle in improving the access to education seems to be geographic. The more we go towards south and west, the more people seems to perceive it positively. This means that it is quite different from one district to another and even from one village to another as we can see it in the correlations graphics.

- Considering Nepotism as a trust obstacle for the government
- Having the feeling that the basic services of the government in relation to water has improved

- Considering that insufficient acces to education, high level of conflict and low level of incomes have an impact on instability in the area
- Considering Education as one of the main needs
- Considering Security as a main driver of instability
- Having many men in the household
- Considering FMS as  one of the most trusted governance system for Food Security
